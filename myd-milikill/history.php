                                <p>The Youth Development Ministry started as a unit in the Deputy Governor’s office in 1980, and then it moved to Ministry of Information, Youth and Culture then to Youths/Sports Bureau, then to Ministry of Youths and Social Welfare, then to Ministry of Women Affairs and Youth Development.</p>

                                <p>In 2008, the unit became a full-fledged Ministry now called Ministry of Youth Development. Youth are one of the greatest assets that any nation can have. Not only are they legitimately regarded as the future leaders, they are potentially and actually the greatest investment for country’s development.</p>

                                <p>Young women and men are, in particular, recognized as a vital resource whose future prospects are inextricably tied to that of their country. They are valued possession of any nation or region. Without them there can be no future. They are the center of reconstruction and development.</p>

                                <p>Youth development is the training of mind and body of the youth for proper integration into the society and for positive development. It involves the provision of infrastructure, creation of institutions, and processes that will enhance the development of the youth. Government has over the years strived to create a favourable condition for youth development but efforts put in place are not commensurate with the enormous problems confronting youth development. The long neglect of the youth development sector has resulted in youth restiveness, militancy, unemployment etc and if not properly addressed may lead to national insecurity and chaos hence the need for a comprehensive plan and programmes for youth development.</p>
